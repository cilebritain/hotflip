# An informal implement for hotflip
Here are some suggestions for running the code:
1. Please install the ESIM package at first(you can run the setup.py in the ESIM folder, or install the package from the internet).
2. Please prepare your data and model parameter (for BERT, please follow the rules of transformers package, for ESIM, you should have .pth file, You can contract me if you do not have the parameter).
3. Please modify the file path in the code to make sure that your data and parameter are in the proper path. You can also modify the data preprocessing process to adapt to your data format.
4. Finally you can run `python attack.py` or `python attack_nli.py` to run the code.
